It's extremely hard to elaborate on why cross-platform is great or terrible without hand-waving and qualitative / anecdotal takes. "AirBnB backed out of React Native! Walmart uses it! Write once use everywhere!"

This document tries to make an objective comparison between native and cross-platform technologies, supplementing anecdotal experiences with quantitative measurements from the community.
